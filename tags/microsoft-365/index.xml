&lt;p>Large-scale construction projects often grapple with fragmented data, misaligned communications, and inefficient workflows. A Common Data Environment (CDE) addresses these challenges by providing a centralized platform to manage, collaborate on, and leverage critical project data throughout a project&amp;rsquo;s lifecycle. SharePoint, deeply integrated within Microsoft 365, emerges as a powerful, secure, and scalable solution ideal for managing complex construction data.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Real-World Success Stories: Why Leading Construction Firms Choose SharePoint as Their CDE</title><link>https://flinker.app/blog/sharepoint-cde-success-stories/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://flinker.app/blog/sharepoint-cde-success-stories/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Real-World Success Stories: Why Leading Construction Firms Choose SharePoint as Their CDE&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Implementing a Common Data Environment (CDE) like SharePoint can dramatically transform construction project management. Here, we explore practical examples from industry leaders, highlight specific metrics, and detail how SharePoint compares favorably against traditional CDE solutions.&lt;/p>
