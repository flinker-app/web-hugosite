&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://flinker.app/assets-flinker/images/blog/blog-img-3-1.png" alt="SharePoint Common Data Environment in Construction">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In today’s construction industry, success depends on managing data effectively across global teams, complex projects, and tight deadlines. Traditional tools like spreadsheets, shared drives, and siloed platforms are no longer enough. That’s why many leading construction firms are adopting &lt;strong>SharePoint as a Common Data Environment (CDE)&lt;/strong> — transforming scattered information into streamlined, collaborative, and secure workflows.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Visualize BIM Models in Power BI with Flinker's 3D Viewer</title><link>https://flinker.app/blog/visualize-bim-in-power-bi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://flinker.app/blog/visualize-bim-in-power-bi/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="visualize-bim-models-in-power-bi-using-flinkers-3d-viewer">Visualize BIM Models in Power BI using Flinker&amp;rsquo;s 3D Viewer&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>In the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations (AECO) industry, &lt;strong>IFC (Industry Foundation Classes)&lt;/strong> has become the standard for sharing Building Information Modeling (BIM) data across platforms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Professionals build rich 3D models, but when it’s time to present them in Power BI, something’s missing: the model itself. No geometry, no visual context, just numbers. Power BI doesn’t natively support IFC.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
