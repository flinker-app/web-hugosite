This Schedule A defines the scope, service levels, and operating rules for Flinker support plans (“Support Plans”). It supplements the **Flinker Services Terms** (the “Master Terms”). Capitalized terms not defined here have the meaning set out in the Master Terms.

**Applies to:** Enterprise Basic Support Plan, Enterprise Plus Support Plan, Success Hours (if purchased)

<h2 id="purpose-and-structure">1. Purpose and Structure</h2>

1.1 **Purpose.** This Schedule A defines the scope, service levels, and operating rules for Flinker support plans (“Support Plans”). Support Plans are intended to provide **reactive L2/L3 product support** for licensed Flinker applications in a Microsoft 365 environment and (if purchased) **prepaid advisory services (“Success Hours”)** for non-incident requests.

1.2 **Plan-specific entitlements.** Support is provided according to the purchased Support Plan(s) described in the applicable order form, quote, subscription, or statement of work (each an “Order”).

1.3 **No service credits (V1).** Unless explicitly agreed in an Order, service level targets in this Schedule A are **targets** and do not create service credits, penalties, or liquidated damages.

<h2 id="support-plans-overview">2. Support Plans Overview</h2>

2.1 **Enterprise Basic Support Plan (Reactive L2/L3).**
Reactive L2/L3 support for **Incidents** and **Bugs** in **Production** for licensed Flinker applications, during **Business Hours**, excluding L1 end-user support.

2.2 **Enterprise Plus Support Plan (Upgrade).**
Enhanced reactive L2/L3 support for Production Incidents with faster response targets, higher priority handling, increased capacity, and (where applicable) post-incident review for P1 events.

2.3 **Success Hours (Advisory / Enablement) – optional add-on.**
Prepaid advisory hours for **Service Requests** (non-incident), such as guidance, reviews, enablement, and non-break/fix requests, as defined in Section 10.

2.4 **Start of service.** Unless otherwise stated in an Order, Support Plans start at the customer’s **Production go-live** date for the relevant Flinker application(s).

<h2 id="definitions">3. Definitions</h2>

3.1 **Business Hours** means Monday to Friday, 09:00–17:00 CET/CEST (Berlin time), excluding public holidays in Germany, unless otherwise stated in an Order.

3.2 **Production** means the customer’s live operational environment used for business operations (as opposed to test, development, or staging environments).

3.3 **Incident** means an unplanned interruption or material degradation of Production functionality attributable to the Flinker product (or its supported configuration) that prevents or materially impairs intended use.

3.4 **Bug** means a reproducible deviation of the Flinker product from its documented behavior.

3.5 **Problem** means the underlying cause of one or more Incidents.

3.6 **Service Request** means a request that is **not** an Incident or Bug, including “how-to”, usage guidance, advisory questions, configuration guidance, enablement, optimization, documentation, workshops, or best-practice discussions.

3.7 **Supported Environment** means a Microsoft 365 tenant and configuration that meets Flinker’s published prerequisites and is within vendor support. Support may be limited where issues are caused by (i) customer configuration, (ii) third-party products/services not expressly supported by Flinker, or (iii) Microsoft platform incidents or changes.

3.8 **Case** means a single support ticket logged by the customer regarding one topic. Flinker may group, split, or reclassify Cases for operational efficiency.

3.9 **Initial Response** means acknowledgement of a Case and commencement of triage, including (where applicable) initial clarification questions and immediate mitigation guidance.

<h2 id="scope-of-support-reactive-l2l3">4. Scope of Support (Reactive L2/L3)</h2>

4.1 **Included (Enterprise Basic and Enterprise Plus).** Flinker will provide reactive L2/L3 support for in-scope Incidents and Bugs affecting licensed Flinker applications in Production, including:

a) triage, diagnosis, and issue reproduction (where possible);

b) guidance on mitigations or workarounds (where feasible);

c) investigation of root cause within product boundaries and available telemetry/logs;

d) defect correction through standard releases, patches, or hotfixes, at Flinker’s discretion;

e) reasonable coordination with the customer’s technical contact and guidance for engaging Microsoft support where a platform issue is suspected.

4.2 **Out of scope (unless purchased as Success Hours or separately agreed).** The following are not included in Support Plans:

a) L1 helpdesk / end-user support;

b) training, adoption, or usage enablement (unless Success Hours are purchased);

c) tenant administration performed on behalf of the customer;

d) custom development, enhancements, feature requests, customer-specific changes;

e) data migration, bulk data operations, data cleanup;

f) support for unsupported configurations or third-party solutions outside explicitly supported integrations;

g) professional services/project delivery not explicitly included in an Order.

4.3 **Non-Production environments.** Unless explicitly included in an Order, Flinker may provide best-effort assistance for Non-Production issues but does not commit to the SLA targets set out in Section 8 for Non-Production.

<h2 id="customer-responsibilities-sla-preconditions">5. Customer Responsibilities (SLA Preconditions)</h2>

5.1 **Technical contacts.** The customer will appoint at least one qualified technical contact with authority to:

a) provide environment details and access;

b) validate workarounds;

c) perform configuration changes on the customer side;

d) engage Microsoft support where required.

5.2 **Information and cooperation.** To enable timely resolution and SLA measurement, the customer will provide without undue delay:

a) clear problem description, business impact, severity, and affected users;

b) timestamps, reproduction steps, screenshots, error messages;

c) relevant tenant/environment details and logs (where available);

d) remote access or session participation when necessary.

5.3 **Platform/vendor engagement.** Where a Case is likely caused by Microsoft 365 platform behavior, outages, or changes, the customer is responsible for opening and managing a Microsoft support ticket under its own support relationship, and sharing status updates with Flinker.

<h2 id="support-intake-channels-and-case-handling">6. Support Intake, Channels, and Case Handling</h2>

6.1 **Supported channels.** Cases may be submitted via the channels stated in the Order (e.g., support email address, customer portal). Flinker may require Cases to be submitted in writing for tracking purposes.

6.2 **Case content requirements.** Each Case must include:

a) requested severity (P1–P4);

b) whether Production or Non-Production;

c) business impact (users/processes blocked);

d) relevant context and evidence (Section 5.2).

6.3 **Reclassification.** Flinker may reclassify:

a) severity (based on definitions in Section 7); and/or

b) classification as Incident/Bug vs. Service Request.

If a Case is primarily a Service Request, Flinker may route it to Success Hours (if purchased) or propose a separate engagement.

<h2 id="severity-levels-p1-p4">7. Severity Levels (P1–P4)</h2>

7.1 **Severity definitions (Production).**

* **P1 – Critical:** Production outage or severe business impact; core workflows blocked; no reasonable workaround.
* **P2 – High:** Major degradation or key functionality unavailable; limited workaround exists.
* **P3 – Medium:** Non-critical issue; limited impact; workaround available.
* **P4 – Low:** Cosmetic/minor issue; informational request; enhancement-like request.

7.2 **Severity examples.** Examples are illustrative and not exhaustive. Final severity classification is determined by Flinker based on business impact and scope.

<h2 id="service-level-targets-sla">8. Service Level Targets (SLA)</h2>

8.1 **General.** SLAs apply only to:

a) in-scope Incidents/Bugs in a Supported Environment;

b) Production (unless otherwise agreed);

c) Cases submitted with required information and customer cooperation (Section 5).

8.2 **Enterprise Basic – SLA Targets (Business Hours).**

**Initial Response Targets**

* **P1:** within **4 business hours**
* **P2:** within **1 business day**
* **P3:** within **2 business days**
* **P4:** within **5 business days**

**Update Frequency Targets**

* **P1:** at least every **4 business hours** during active handling
* **P2:** at least **daily** during active handling
* **P3:** at least **weekly** (or at material milestones)
* **P4:** **monthly** (or at material milestones)

8.3 **Enterprise Plus – SLA Targets (Enhanced).**

**Initial Response Targets**

* **P1:** within **1 business hour**
* **P2:** within **4 business hours**
* **P3:** within **1 business day**
* **P4:** within **3 business days**

**Update Frequency Targets**

* **P1:** at least every **2 business hours** during active handling
* **P2:** at least **daily** during active handling
* **P3:** at least **weekly** (or at material milestones)
* **P4:** **monthly** (or at material milestones)

8.4 **Workarounds and resolution.** Flinker will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide workarounds and resolutions. Final resolution timelines may depend on external factors (e.g., Microsoft platform issues, customer configuration changes, release cadence).

8.5 **24x7 coverage (optional, not included in V1 by default).** If 24x7 response for P1 is purchased, the Order must explicitly state the coverage window and response targets.

<h2 id="fair-use-and-capacity-controls-v1">9. Fair Use and Capacity Controls (V1)</h2>

9.1 **Reasonable use.** Support Plans are intended for normal operational support for the licensed applications and are subject to reasonable use.

9.2 **Concurrent active Case cap.** To ensure predictable capacity:

* **Enterprise Basic:** up to **5 concurrently active Cases** per customer across all severities.
* **Enterprise Plus:** up to **10 concurrently active Cases** per customer across all severities.

9.3 **Active Case definition.** A Case is “active” if Flinker is performing ongoing work or awaiting customer input necessary to proceed. Cases may be set to “pending customer” where customer input is required; prolonged inactivity may pause SLA measurement.

9.4 **Excess load.** If the customer exceeds the concurrent active Case cap, Flinker may:

a) queue additional Cases; and/or

b) propose Success Hours or a separate statement of work for additional capacity.

<h2 id="success-hours-advisory-enablement">10. Success Hours (Advisory / Enablement)</h2>

10.1 **Scope.** Success Hours cover Service Requests, including:

a) best-practice guidance (e.g., SharePoint CDE governance, permissions patterns);

b) configuration guidance and reviews (customer executes changes unless agreed otherwise);

c) health checks, optimization discussions, release/change readiness;

d) “how-to” usage guidance and enablement sessions.

10.2 **Exclusions.** Success Hours do not include:

a) custom development, enhancements, or feature delivery;

b) tenant administration performed on behalf of the customer (unless agreed);

c) Incident response (covered by Support Plans where in scope).

10.3 **Commercial terms.**

a) Success Hours are sold as **prepaid hours** (e.g., 10 hours: quantity 10 × unit HOUR) at the agreed hourly rate.

b) Unless otherwise stated in the Order, Success Hours expire **12 months** after purchase.

c) Time is tracked in increments of **15 minutes** (0.25h) unless otherwise stated.

d) Delivery is remote unless otherwise agreed.

10.4 **Consumption tracking.** Flinker will track consumption against Cases/work items and provide a summary upon request or at agreed intervals.

<h2 id="escalation-and-post-incident-review-v1">11. Escalation and Post-Incident Review (V1)</h2>

11.1 **Escalation.** For P1/P2 Cases, Flinker may escalate internally to engineering as required. The customer must ensure technical contacts are reachable for timely decisions and testing.

11.2 **RCA light (Enterprise Plus, P1 only).** For P1 Incidents, Flinker will provide a lightweight post-incident summary within **10 business days**, typically including:

a) incident summary; b) timeline; c) suspected/confirmed root cause (if known); d) mitigation; e) corrective actions (if applicable).

<h2 id="term-renewal-and-changes">12. Term, Renewal, and Changes</h2>

12.1 **Term.** Each Support Plan term is as stated in the Order (typically 12 months).

12.2 **Renewal.** Renewal terms (if any) are governed by the Order and the Master Terms.

12.3 **Changes to this Schedule.** Flinker may publish updated versions of this Schedule A. Updates apply **only** to new Orders or renewals unless the parties agree otherwise in writing.

<h2 id="order-of-precedence">13. Order of Precedence</h2>

13.1 If there is a conflict between:

a) the Master Terms;

b) this Schedule A; and

c) an Order,

the following order of precedence applies **for Support Plans**: **Order → Schedule A → Master Terms**.

<h2 id="miscellaneous">14. Miscellaneous</h2>

14.1 **No guarantee of resolution.** While Flinker will use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve in-scope Incidents and Bugs, outcomes may depend on external systems and factors beyond Flinker’s control.

14.2 **Third-party services.** Microsoft 365 and other third-party services are outside Flinker’s control. Platform outages, vendor changes, or limitations may impact support outcomes and timelines.
