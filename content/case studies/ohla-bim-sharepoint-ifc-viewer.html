  company: |
    OHLA (Obrascón Huarte Lain) is a Spain‑based global company focused on infrastructure, concessions, and construction across transport infrastructure, industrial plants, and real estate development. Its shares trade on the Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, and Valencia stock exchanges. As of mid‑2025, OHLA reported a backlog of about €7.572 billion.

  challenge_h2: "Make IFC models available inside SharePoint for project teams"
  challenge: |
    Project stakeholders needed to inspect and discuss IFC models without leaving SharePoint or moving files to external tools. The solution had to support open BIM practices, respect Microsoft 365 security, and keep all data private while improving communication and documentation across projects.

  solution_h3: "SharePoint‑embedded IFC Viewer for open BIM collaboration"
  solution_intro: |
    OHLA adopted Flinker’s IFC Viewer integrated with Microsoft 365. IFC Models stored in OHLA's SharePoint document libraries to open — either from the list View command in the sharepoint folders or via an embedded Web Part — and the same experience is available as a Teams tab. All processing stays client‑side within OHLA's current Microsoft 365 tenant. No process changes and no new data platform.

  solution_steps:
    - "Install Flinker’s IFC Viewer in Microsoft 365."
    - "From a SharePoint document library, select one or more .ifc files and click \"View\" to open models from folder directly."
    - "Embed the IFC Viewer Web Part on SharePoint pages for an integrated viewing experience."
    - "Add the Teams IFC Viewer as a tab in Teams project channels."
    - "Use search, filter, isolate, clipping, measurements, and floor plans to analyze models; export selected properties to Excel if needed."

  solution_notes: |
    Privacy-first deployment: files never leave Microsoft 365; processing is client-side and can be scoped to a single SharePoint site for clean governance.

  results_intro: "Outcomes reported by the user:"
  results_list:
    - "Centralized BIM data in SharePoint with IFC models accessible where the team already works."
    - "Improved communication and documentation with open BIM workflows across architects, engineers, and owners."
    - "Compliance-friendly collaboration with no file uploads to external servers; all within Microsoft 365."
  future: |
    OHLA plans to expand the SharePoint IFC Viewer across more business units and standardize model review pages as part of the corporate intranet. Next steps include adding the Teams tab to more project channels and connecting selected properties to Excel and Power BI for portfolio‑level dashboards. The goal is a governed, search‑friendly model library with consistent LOIN documentation across projects.
testimonial:
  text: "The Flinker IFC viewer and its integration with SharePoint allow us to showcase examples of how BIM data is used and what the LOIN requirements from public administrations entail."
