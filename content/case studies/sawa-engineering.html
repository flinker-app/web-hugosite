  company: |
    **Sawa Engineering** is a young engineering firm focused on innovative and data-driven infrastructure projects.

  challenge_h2: "Fast, reliable quantities within tight schedules"
  challenge: |
    In a complex BIM environment, the team needed robust quantity takeoff and segmentation of reinforced concrete elements by floors and construction phases — including cost mapping — while keeping decision-makers supplied with transparent data across multiple design variants.
    The process had to minimize tool switching and leverage existing Excel know-how to keep the learning curve low and iteration speed high.

  solution_h3: "Excel-centric analysis with model context from Flinker Copilot"
  solution_intro: |
    Sawa Engineering combined **Flinker Copilot** and the **Excel IFC Viewer** to link BIM data directly with Excel — enabling quantity takeoff, cost mapping, and model QA in one connected flow inside Microsoft 365.

  solution_steps:
    - "Connected model parameters to Excel via **Flinker Copilot** and the **IFC Viewer**."
    - "Applied **rule-based queries** to segment reinforced-concrete elements by floor and construction section."
    - "Used **Excel filters & formulas** for cost mapping and variant comparison."
    - "Validated results in Microsoft 365 with live model context—no third-party tools or exports."

  solution_notes: |
    Parameter issues (e.g., basement walls mislabeled as ground-floor walls) were surfaced early and corrected quickly, accelerating iteration across three design variants.
    For this public case, a sample IFC reproduces the exact workflow without exposing project data.

  results_intro: "Outcomes reported by the user:"
  results_list:
    - "Reliable evaluation of three variants within three weeks"
    - "Chosen solution shortens shell construction from ~10 to ~7 months"
    - "All variants available with transparent, decision-ready data"
    - "Iterations significantly faster than traditional methods, with minimal learning curve"
  kpis:
    - label: "Time to evaluate 3 variants"
      value: "3 weeks"
    - label: "Shell construction (chosen vs. prior plan)"
      value: "~ 7 vs. 10 mo"
    - label: "Variants compared"
      value: "3 variants"

  future: |
    Sawa Engineering plans to extend the workflow to MEP and façade models and connect cost data to Power BI for live dashboards.
