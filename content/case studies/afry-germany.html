sections:
  company: |
    AFRY is a global engineering, design, digital, and advisory company with Nordic roots and global reach.
    18,000 experts across industry, energy, and infrastructure accelerate the transition to a sustainable society.
    Listed on Nasdaq Stockholm, AFRY reported net sales of 27 BSEK and creates impact for generations.

  challenge_h2: "Validate attributes and keep performance with hundreds of IFC models"
  challenge: |
    Projects can include 200–600 IFC models across categories, with files ranging from tens to hundreds of megabytes.
    Some models lack volume values; geometry-based calculation may be needed. Attribute quality must be checked against requirements (IDS).
    Stakeholders want customizable templates, filters, and color mapping, with links to project plans and dashboards for status visibility.

  solution_h3: "Excel‑centric analysis with model context from Flinker Copilot"
  solution_intro: |
    Using the Excel IFC Viewer, AFRY can load many IFCs, filter and color elements, and query classifications and parameters via Power Query.
    Flinker Copilot supports IDS‑style attribute checks to highlight gaps for modelers to fix.
    The workflow stays inside Microsoft 365, with optional Power BI dashboards connected for reporting.

  solution_steps:
    - "Load multiple IFC models with the Excel IFC Viewer (100+ tested; pilot toward 200–600)."
    - "Use Power Query to extract attributes and classifications for analysis."
    - "Apply filters and color mapping to visualize status and link to a project plan."
    - "Run IDS‑style checks with Flinker Copilot to validate required parameters."
    - "Optionally compute volumes from geometry when values are missing in the IFC."

  solution_notes: |
    Queries can be extended to read all IFC attributes; geometry‑based volume calculation is feasible when needed.
    A phased pilot (under NDA if required) will tune loader balancing and templates to AFRY’s data.

  results_intro: "Outcomes reported by the user:"

  future: |
    Pilot with 200–600 models to benchmark performance and finalize templates.
    Advance IDS validation to production for attribute QA; add geometry‑based volume calculation where required.
    Connect Excel outputs to Power BI dashboards and consider BCF 2.1/3.0 issue workflows.
