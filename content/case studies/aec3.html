  company: |
    AEC3 Deutschland is a Munich-based leader in BIM management with more than 25 years of experience. As one of Germany’s early adopters of BIM, they combine comprehensive consulting and hands-on BIM management with deep expertise in IFC development and implementation—helping construction and infrastructure teams collaborate more effectively and deliver with confidence.

  challenge_h2: "Interdisciplinary Clash Detection in BIM Models"
  challenge: |
    AEC3 needed an efficient solution to visualize and detect clashes between models from different disciplines (e.g., structural, mechanical). The challenge was to improve collision detection processes while keeping track of numerous complex model components.

  solution_h3: "Clash Detection and Visualization with Flinker's IFC Viewer"
  solution_intro: |
    AEC3 chose Flinker's IFC Viewer to visualize and manage inter-disciplinary clashes, enhancing their ability to detect issues early in the design phase. The solution integrates seamlessly with Power BI, enabling comprehensive analysis and model connections.

  solution_steps:
    - "Step 1: Import IFC models into Flinker's IFC Viewer"
    - "Step 2: Visualize clashes within Power BI for easier analysis"
    - "Step 3: Utilize Excel integration to manage and cross-reference results"
    - "Step 4: Enhance model analysis by using Power BI's visualization capabilities"

  solution_notes: |
    The integration of multiple Microsoft 365 tools ensured a smooth workflow for AEC3, allowing for easy data transfer and model interaction without leaving their Microsoft ecosystem.

  results_intro: "Outcomes reported by the user:"
  results_list:
    - "Efficient interdisciplinary clash detection"
    - "Improved collaboration through integrated BIM models"
    - "Faster issue identification and resolution in construction models"

  kpis:
    - label: "Clashes Detected"
      value: "135"
    - label: "Clashes Resolved"
      value: "78"

  future: |
    AEC3 plans to expand the integration with additional project data sources and further optimize the visualization of clashes using AI-based tools.

testimonial:
  text: "The ability to visualize clashes across multiple disciplines within a single platform has dramatically improved our process. We can now resolve issues earlier, saving time and costs on site."
