sections:
  company: |
    **Sawa Engineering** is a young engineering firm focused on innovative and data-driven infrastructure projects.

  challenge_h2: "Fast, reliable quantities within tight schedules"
  challenge: |
    In a complex BIM environment, the team needed robust quantity takeoff and segmentation of reinforced concrete elements by floors and construction phases — including cost mapping — while keeping decision-makers supplied with transparent data across multiple design variants.
    The process had to minimize tool switching and leverage existing Excel know-how to keep the learning curve low and iteration speed high.

  solution_h3: "Excel-centric analysis with model context from Flinker Copilot"
  solution_intro: |
    Sawa Engineering combined **Flinker Copilot** and the **Excel IFC Viewer** to link BIM data directly with Excel — enabling quantity takeoff, cost mapping, and model QA in one connected flow inside Microsoft 365.

  solution_steps:
    - "Connected model parameters to Excel via **Flinker Copilot** and the **IFC Viewer**."
    - "Applied **rule-based queries** to segment reinforced-concrete elements by floor and construction section."
    - "Used **Excel filters & formulas** for cost mapping and variant comparison."
    - "Validated results in Microsoft 365 with live model context—no third-party tools or exports."

  solution_notes: |
    Parameter issues (e.g., basement walls mislabeled as ground-floor walls) were surfaced early and corrected quickly, accelerating iteration across three design variants.
    For this public case, a sample IFC reproduces the exact workflow without exposing project data.

  results_intro: "Outcomes reported by the user:"
  results_list:
    - "Reliable evaluation of three variants within three weeks"
    - "Chosen solution shortens shell construction from ~10 to ~7 months"
    - "All variants available with transparent, decision-ready data"
    - "Iterations significantly faster than traditional methods, with minimal learning curve"
  kpis:
    - label: "Time to evaluate 3 variants"
      value: "3 weeks"
    - label: "Shell construction (chosen vs. prior plan)"
      value: "~ 7 vs. 10 mo"
    - label: "Variants compared"
      value: "3 variants"

  future: |
    Sawa Engineering plans to extend the workflow to MEP and façade models and connect cost data to Power BI for live dashboards.


testimonial:
  text: "With Flinker Copilot and IFC Viewer for Microsoft 365, we evaluate models transparently and quickly, without extra interfaces. That speeds us up and makes our handover to schedule and cost planning more reliable."
