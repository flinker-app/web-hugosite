Integrate and interact with IFC models within your dashboards for enhanced project insights without using any extra software.


## Power BI BIM Integration

In the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations (AECO) industry, **IFC (Industry Foundation Classes)** has become the standard for sharing Building Information Modeling (BIM) data across platforms. 

Professionals build rich 3D models, but when it’s time to present them in Power BI, something’s missing: the model itself. No geometry, no visual context, just numbers. Power BI doesn’t natively support IFC. 

As a result, project stakeholders struggle with disconnected tools, screen-sharing, and cumbersome workflows.

**Flinker’s 3D IFC Viewer** changes this by embedding IFC models directly into Power BI, offering:

- Interactive 3D views next to live data, charts, and KPIs.
- No plugins, no extra licenses, and no technical overhead.

In this post, you’ll learn **how to load IFC files in Power BI** using Flinker’s 3D Viewer, step by step.



## What Makes Flinker’s 3D IFC Viewer a Game-Changer for Power BI?

A true missing link between BIM and Power BI:

- Eliminates the need for external software or complex data conversions.
- Brings visual BIM data directly into your analytical environment.
- Unlocks the potential of visualizing BIM models within Power BI dashboards.

### Key Benefits:

- No Extra Software Required: Visualize IFC models directly within Power BI.
- Interactive 3D View: Explore models with intuitive pan, zoom, and rotate functionalities.
- Connects BIM to Dashboards: Link spatial data with Power BI metrics for comprehensive insights.

### 2. Configure the IFC Source
- In the visual's settings, paste a direct link to your IFC file (e.g., from SharePoint, Windows Explorer, cloud storage or project platform).
- Open or create the report where you'd like to include the BIM model.

### 3. Insert the Viewer
- Add the **Flinker IFC Viewer** from your Visualizations pane to your report canvas.

### 4. Edit Parameters
- Click the visual, open the **Format pane**, and fill in the IFC file path.

### 5. Apply & View
- Click **“Apply changes”** and the viewer will render the interactive 3D model inside your report.

### 6. Interact with the Model
- Use your mouse to **pan, zoom, and rotate** to explore all project aspects.
