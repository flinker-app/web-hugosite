# Visualize BIM Models in Power BI using Flinker's 3D Viewer

## Power BI BIM Integration
Integrate and interact with IFC models within your dashboards for enhanced project insights without using any extra software.


## Introduction

In the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations (AECO) industry, **IFC (Industry Foundation Classes)** has become the standard for sharing Building Information Modeling (BIM) data across platforms. 

Professionals build rich 3D models, but when it‚Äôs time to present them in Power BI, something‚Äôs missing: the model itself. No geometry, no visual context, just numbers. Power BI doesn‚Äôt natively support IFC. 

As a result, project stakeholders struggle with disconnected tools, screen-sharing, and cumbersome workflows.

**Flinker‚Äôs 3D IFC Viewer** changes this by embedding IFC models directly into Power BI, offering:

- Interactive 3D views next to live data, charts, and KPIs.
- No plugins, no extra licenses, and no technical overhead.

In this post, you‚Äôll learn **how to load IFC files in Power BI** using Flinker‚Äôs 3D Viewer, step by step.



## What Makes Flinker‚Äôs 3D IFC Viewer a Game-Changer for Power BI?

A true missing link between BIM and Power BI:

- Eliminates the need for external software or complex data conversions.
- Brings visual BIM data directly into your analytical environment.
- Unlocks the potential of visualizing BIM models within Power BI dashboards.

### Key Benefits:

- **No Extra Software Required**: Visualize IFC models directly within Power BI.
- **Interactive 3D View**: Explore models with intuitive pan, zoom, and rotate functionalities.
- **Connects BIM to Dashboards**: Link spatial data with Power BI metrics for comprehensive insights.



## Step-by-Step Guide: How to Use the Viewer in Power BI

### 1. Get the Visual
- Go to **Microsoft AppSource** and add the **Flinker IFC Viewer** to your Power BI environment or Desktop.

### 2. Configure the IFC Source
- In the visual's settings, paste a direct link to your IFC file (e.g., from cloud storage or project platform).
- Open or create the report where you'd like to include the BIM model.

### 3. Insert the Viewer
- Add the **Flinker IFC Viewer** from your Visualizations pane to your report canvas.

### 4. Edit Parameters
- Click the visual, open the **Format pane**, and fill in:
  - IFC file URL
  - Model settings
  - Background color
  - Transparency
  - Initial Camera Position

### 5. Apply & View
- Click **‚ÄúApply changes‚Äù** and the viewer will render the interactive 3D model inside your report.

### 6. Interact with the Model
- Use your mouse to **pan, zoom, and rotate** to explore all project aspects.



## Real World Common Use Cases

**Flinker‚Äôs 3D IFC Viewer** unlocks value for various stakeholders across the AECO industry:

### BIM Managers:
- Enhance project reviews with interactive 3D models.
- Compare model geometry with KPIs inside Power BI.
- Review model changes and coordination issues seamlessly.

### Project Managers:
- Connect 3D visual insights with progress, schedule, and cost data.
- Monitor conflicts and project progress in real time.

### Facility Teams:
- Visualize building assets directly within Power BI.
- Plan maintenance tasks based on model data like energy consumption and maintenance records.
- Enable efficient facility management and asset lifecycle planning.


## FAQ: IFC Viewer for Power BI

### Is the Flinker Viewer free?
Yes!  
The viewer is free to download via AppSource. It ensures full privacy as files remain local and are never uploaded to a server.

### Can Power BI open IFC files?
No, Power BI does not natively support IFC files.  
**Flinker‚Äôs 3D Viewer** enables this by embedding the IFC model into Power BI reports.

### What‚Äôs the difference between Revit and IFC?
- **Revit**: Proprietary BIM authoring tool by Autodesk.
- **IFC**: Open, neutral file format for interoperability across BIM tools (including Revit).

### Where does the data live?
The viewer uses the IFC file URL you provide.  
No data is stored by Flinker ‚Äî the file remains in your specified location (e.g., cloud storage, SharePoint, OneDrive).



## Conclusion

Turn your juggling experience with external software and complex data conversions into ease.

**Flinker‚Äôs 3D IFC Viewer** brings the power of visual BIM data directly into Power BI.  
You can now unite your BIM models and business insights into one interactive space, enabling:
