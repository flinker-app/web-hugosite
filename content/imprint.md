## 2. Eligibility

### Liability for content
As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with general laws. As a service provider, however, we are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information in accordance with general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific infringement of law. If we become aware of such legal violations, we will remove this content immediately.

### Liability for links
Our website contains links to external websites of third parties over whose content we have no influence. For this reason, we cannot assume any liability for this external content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not discernible at the time the link was created. However, continuous monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement of law. If we become aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.

### Copyright

Duplication, processing, distribution and any kind of use outside the limits of copyright law require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please notify us accordingly. If we become aware of legal violations, we will remove such content immediately.
