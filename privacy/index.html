If a corresponding consent has been requested (e.g., consent to the storage of cookies), the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR; the consent can be revoked at any time.</p><p>If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font will be used by your computer.</p><p>Further information on Google Web Fonts can be found at <a href=https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq>Google Web Fonts FAQ</a> and in <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de">Google&rsquo;s privacy policy</a>.</p><p><em>Source: e-recht24.de</em></p><h2 id=7-google-analytics>7. Google Analytics</h2><p>If you have given your consent, Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Ireland Limited (&ldquo;Google&rdquo;), is used in the services. The use includes the &ldquo;Universal Analytics&rdquo; operating mode.

The information generated by the cookie about your use of the services is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, if IP anonymization is activated in the services, your IP address will be shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. We would like to point out that Google Analytics has been extended on this website to include IP anonymization in order to ensure anonymous collection of IP addresses (so-called IP masking). The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data.
