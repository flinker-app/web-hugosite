A Common Data Environment (CDE) addresses these challenges by providing a centralized platform to manage, collaborate on, and leverage critical project data throughout a project&amp;rsquo;s lifecycle. SharePoint, deeply integrated within Microsoft 365, emerges as a powerful, secure, and scalable solution ideal for managing complex construction data.&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="1-data-sovereignty-and-security">1. &lt;strong>Data Sovereignty and Security&lt;/strong>&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>SharePoint ensures your project data stays securely within your own Microsoft environment, enhancing data sovereignty and compliance. This reduces dependency on external third-party cloud solutions, ensuring maximum data control and security.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Leading Construction Companies Use SharePoint as a Common Data Environment (CDE)</title><link>https://flinker.app/blog/sharepoint-cde-success-stories/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://flinker.app/blog/sharepoint-cde-success-stories/</guid><description>&lt;p>In today’s construction industry, success depends on managing data effectively across global teams, complex projects, and tight deadlines. Traditional tools like spreadsheets, shared drives, and siloed platforms are no longer enough. That’s why many leading construction firms are adopting &lt;strong>SharePoint as a Common Data Environment (CDE)&lt;/strong> transforming scattered information into streamlined, collaborative, and secure workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="from-chaos-to-clarity-why-sharepoint">From Chaos to Clarity: Why SharePoint?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Construction teams often struggle with fragmented project data. Lost emails, outdated documents, and unsupported legacy tools cause costly delays and coordination errors. SharePoint changes this dynamic.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Visualize BIM Models in Power BI with Flinker's 3D Viewer</title><link>https://flinker.app/blog/visualize-bim-in-power-bi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://flinker.app/blog/visualize-bim-in-power-bi/</guid><description>&lt;p>Integrate and interact with IFC models within your dashboards for enhanced project insights without using any extra software.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations (AECO) industry, &lt;strong>IFC (Industry Foundation Classes)&lt;/strong> has become the standard for sharing Building Information Modeling (BIM) data across platforms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Professionals build rich 3D models, but when it’s time to present them in Power BI, something’s missing: the model itself. No geometry, no visual context, just numbers. Power BI doesn’t natively support IFC.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
